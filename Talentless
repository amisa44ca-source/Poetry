#Talentless

Cheerful words float around them,
Light shining from their diadems.

Bright grins drown at their sight—
When are they not right?

In the shadows, fragmented hearts are served in porcelain plates,
The golden kids already ate the mediocre' fates.

The ordinary licked praises from the floor like dogs,
But the gates of being seen are eternally locked.

Their names don't leave the mouth with pride,
They leave with the heart disgusted inside.

Shadows of the ordinary rot on the floor,
Fleas on the cold, dry blood in their core.

Luxury of being cherished lies in a box with a hidden key,
The talented dance around it with glee.

A box strong enough to make them crawl,
But the key was never meant for all.

So the limbs falter until they rot—
Some kids are only born to fall.
